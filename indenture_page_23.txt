Section 307. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Security which is
payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or
one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date
(herein called “Defaulted Interest”) shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having
been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or
(2) below:
(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest payable on Securities of a series to the Persons in whose
names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a
Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall
notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series and the date
of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the
aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the
Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit
of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee in consultation with the
Company shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not
less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice
of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the
expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date
therefor to be given to each Holder of Securities of such series in the manner set forth in Section 106, not less than 10 days prior
to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor
having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their
respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be
payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not
inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as
may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this
clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 307, each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in
exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such
other Security.
In the case of any Security which is converted after any Regular Record Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment
Date (other than any Security whose Maturity is prior to such Interest Payment Date), interest whose Stated Maturity is on such Interest
Payment Date shall be payable on such Interest Payment Date notwithstanding such conversion, and such interest (whether or not punctually
paid or made available for payment) shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is
registered at the close of business on such Regular Record Date. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the immediately preceding
sentence, in the case of any Security which is converted, interest whose Stated Maturity is after the date of conversion of such Security shall
not be payable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of any Security that may be converted may provide that the provisions of this
paragraph do not apply, or apply with such additions, changes or omissions as may be provided thereby, to such Security.
Section 308. Persons Deemed Owners.
Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the
Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment
of principal of and premium, if any, and, subject to Section 307, any interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether
or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by
notice to the contrary.
