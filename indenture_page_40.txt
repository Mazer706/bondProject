Section 902. Supplemental Indentures With Consent of Holders.
With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series
affected by such supplemental indenture (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange for Securities), by Act of
said Holders delivered to the Company and the Trustee, the Company and the Trustee may enter into an indenture or indentures
supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this
Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series under this Indenture; provided, however, no such
supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected thereby:
(1) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Security;
(2) reduce the principal amount of any Security or reduce the amount of the principal of an Original Issue Discount Security or any
other Security which would be due and payable upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to Section 502,
or reduce the rate of interest on any Security;
(3) reduce any premium payable upon the redemption of or change the date on which any Security may or must be redeemed (it
being understood that a change to any notice requirement with respect to such date shall not be deemed to be a change of such
date);
(4) change the coin or currency in which the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Security is payable;
(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Stated Maturity thereof (or, in
the case of redemption, on or after the Redemption Date);
(6) reduce the percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, the consent of whose Holders is required
for any such supplemental indenture, or the consent of whose Holders is required for any waiver (of compliance with certain
provisions of this Indenture or certain defaults hereunder and their consequences) provided for in this Indenture;
(7) modify any of the provisions of this Section 902, Section 512 or Section 1005, except to increase any such percentage or to
provide that certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the Holder of each
Outstanding Security affected thereby; provided, however, that this clause shall not be deemed to require the consent of any
Holder with respect to changes in the references to “the Trustee” and concomitant changes in this Section 902 and Section 1005,
or the deletion of this proviso, in accordance with the requirements of Section 611 and Section 901(6); or
(8) if the Securities of any series are convertible into or for any other securities or property of the Company, make any change that
adversely affects in any material respect the right to convert any Security of such series (except as permitted by Section 901) or
decrease the conversion rate or increase the conversion price of any such Security of such series, unless such decrease or
increase is permitted by the terms of such Security.
A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been
included solely for the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the rights of the Holders of Securities of such
series with respect to such covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this Indenture of the Holders of
Securities of any other series.
It shall not be necessary for any Act of Holders under this Section 902 to approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental
indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.
After a supplemental indenture under this Section 902 becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Trustee a notice briefly
describing such supplemental indenture or a copy of such supplemental indenture and the Trustee shall mail such notice or supplemental
indenture to Holders affected thereby. Any failure of the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, or any failure of the Company to
mail such supplemental indenture, shall not in any way impair or affect the validity of any such supplemental indenture.
