(23) whether the Securities of the series will be guaranteed by any Person or Persons and, if so, the identity of such Person or
Persons, the terms and conditions upon which such Securities shall be guaranteed and, if applicable, the terms and conditions
upon which such guarantees may be subordinated to other indebtedness of the respective guarantors;

Section 901).
All Securities of any one series shall be substantially identical except as to denomination and except as may otherwise be provided in or
pursuant to the Board Resolution referred to above or pursuant to authority granted by one or more Board Resolutions and, subject to
Section 303, set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in the Officer’s Certificate referred to above or in any such indenture
supplemental hereto. All Securities of any one series need not be issued at one time and, unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to the
Board Resolution referred to above and, subject to Section 303, set forth, or determined in the manner provided, in the Officer’s Certificate
referred to above or pursuant to authority granted by one or more Board Resolutions or in any such indenture supplemental hereto with

action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of

The Securities of each series shall be issuable only in registered form without coupons and only in such denominations as shall be
specified as contemplated by Section 301. In the absence of any such specified denomination with respect to the Securities of any series, the
Securities of such series shall be issuable in denominations of $2,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
Section 303. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by an Officer of the Company (or any Person designated in writing by an
Officer of the Company as authorized to execute and deliver the Securities). The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be
manual or facsimile.
Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind
the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of
such Securities or did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities.
At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series
executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with an Officer’s Certificate and a Company Order for the authentication
and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities. If the
form or terms of the Securities of the series have been established by or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions or pursuant to authority
granted by one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Section 201 and Section 301, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the
additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be provided with, and, subject to Section 601,
shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,
(1) if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution or pursuant to authority granted by one or
more Board Resolutions as permitted by Section 201, that such form has been established in conformity with the provisions of this
Indenture;
