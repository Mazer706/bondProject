(2) if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution or pursuant to authority granted by one
or more Board Resolutions as permitted by Section 301, that such terms have been established in conformity with the provisions
of this Indenture; and
(3) that such Securities, when authenticated by the Trustee and issued and delivered by the Company in the manner and subject to
any conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company
enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws relating to or affecting creditors’ rights generally, (ii) general equitable principles
and (iii) an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such
Securities pursuant to this Indenture will materially adversely affect the Trustee’s own rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this
Indenture or otherwise in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding paragraph of this Section 303, if all Securities of a series are not to
be originally issued at one time, including in the event that the aggregate principal amount of a series of Outstanding Securities is increased
as contemplated by Section 301, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officer’s Certificate, Board Resolution or supplemental indenture
otherwise required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise required pursuant to this Section 303 at
or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original
issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued.
Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such
Security a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such
certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and
delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued
and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309, for all
purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be
entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
Section 304. Temporary Securities.
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and, upon Company Order, the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any
authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities of such series in lieu of which they are issued and with such
appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by
their execution of such Securities.
If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive Securities of such series to be prepared without
unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be
exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the
Company in a Place of Payment for such series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary
Securities of any series, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive
Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Until so exchanged, the
temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such
series and tenor.
