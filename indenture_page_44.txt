If any Security selected for partial redemption is converted in part before termination of the conversion right with respect to the portion of
the Security so selected, the converted portion of such Security shall be deemed (so far as may be) to be the portion selected for redemption.
Securities which have been converted during a selection of securities to be redeemed shall be treated by the Trustee as Outstanding for the
purpose of such selection.
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities selected for redemption as aforesaid and, in case of any
Securities selected for partial redemption as aforesaid, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
The provisions of the three preceding paragraphs shall not apply with respect to any redemption affecting only a single Security, whether
such Security is to be redeemed in whole or in part. In the case of any such redemption in part, the unredeemed portion of the principal
amount of the Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such
Security.
For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall
relate, in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of the principal amount of such Securities which
has been or is to be redeemed. If the Company shall so direct, Securities registered in the name of the Company, any Affiliate or any
Subsidiary thereof shall not be included in the Securities selected for redemption.
Section 1104. Notice of Redemption.
Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid, mailed or otherwise in accordance with the Applicable
Procedures not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date (or within such period as otherwise specified as
contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of a series), to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at such Holderâ€™s address appearing in
the Security Register.
All notices of redemption shall identify the Securities to be redeemed and shall state:
(1) the Redemption Date;
(2) the Redemption Price (or the method of calculating such price);
(3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of more than a single Security are to be redeemed, the
identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of any such Securities, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be
redeemed and, if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series consisting of a single Security are to be redeemed, the
principal amount of the particular Security to be redeemed;
(4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if
applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date;
(5) the place or places where each such Security is to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price;
(6) for any Securities that by their terms may be converted, the terms of conversion, the date on which the right to convert the Security
to be redeemed will terminate and the place or places where such Securities may be surrendered for conversion;
(7) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case; and
(8) if applicable, the CUSIP numbers of the Securities of such series; provided, however, that no representation will be made as to the
correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number, or any similar number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Securities.
