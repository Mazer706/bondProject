(2) In case an Event of Default with respect to any series of Securities has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such
of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series, and use the same degree of
care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her
own affairs.
(3) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent
failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(A) this Section 601(3) shall not be construed to limit the effect of Section 601(1);
(B) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be
proved that the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;
(C) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with
the direction of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series,
determined as provided in Section 101, Section 104 and Section 511, relating to the time, method and place of conducting
any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under
this Indenture with respect to the Securities of such series; and
(D) no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have
reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not
reasonably assured to it.
(4) Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or
affording protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 601.
Section 602. Notice of Defaults.
If a Default or an Event of Default occurs with respect to Securities of any series and is continuing, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder
of Securities of such series notice of the Default within 90 days after written notice of it is received by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee.
Except in the case of a Default in payment of principal of or interest on any Security, the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as a
committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that withholding the notice is not opposed to the interests of Holders of
Securities of such series.
Section 603. Certain Rights of Trustee.

(1) the Trustee may conclusively rely and shall be fully protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate,
statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of
indebtedness or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party
or parties;
(2) if so requested by the Trustee, any request or direction of the Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by a
Company Request or Company Order, and any resolution of the Board of Directors shall be sufficiently evidenced by a Board
Resolution;

taking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the
absence of bad faith on its part, conclusively rely upon an Officerâ€™s Certificate;
(4) the Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection and the advice of such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and

reliance thereon;
