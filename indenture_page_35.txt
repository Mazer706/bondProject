The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and
each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner

Section 611. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed
shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee a written instrument accepting such appointment, and
thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed
or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee, but, on the request of the Company or
the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver a written instrument transferring to such
successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee
all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.
In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the
Company, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an
indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as
shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of
the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the
retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm
that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring
Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture
as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that
nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall
be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and
upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to
the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such
successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and
deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or
those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.
Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in
and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first or second preceding paragraph, as the case
may be.
No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and
eligible under this Article VI.
Section 612. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the
corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder; provided that such corporation shall be otherwise
qualified and eligible under this Article VI, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto.
In case any Securities shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion,
consolidation or sale to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same
effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities; and in case at that time any Securities shall not have been
authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate such Securities either in the name of any predecessor hereunder or in the
name of the successor to the Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which it is anywhere in the Securities or
in this Indenture provided that the certificate of the Trustee shall have.
