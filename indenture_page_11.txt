Section 102. Compliance Certificates and Opinions.
Upon any application or request by the Company to the Trustee to take any action under any provision of this Indenture, the Company
shall furnish to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that all conditions precedent, if any, provided for in this Indenture relating to the
proposed action have been complied with and an Opinion of Counsel stating that in the opinion of such counsel all such conditions precedent,
if any, have been complied with, except that in the case of any such application or request as to which the furnishing of such documents is
specifically required by any provision of this Indenture relating to such particular application or request, no additional certificate or opinion
need be furnished by the Company.
Every certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a condition or covenant provided for in this Indenture (except for certificates
provided for in Section 1004) shall include:
(1) a statement that each individual signing such certificate or opinion has read such covenant or condition and the definitions herein
relating thereto;
(2) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained
in such certificate or opinion are based;
(3) a statement that, in the opinion of each such individual, he or she has made such examination or investigation as is necessary to
enable him or her to express an informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant or condition has been complied with; and
(4) a statement as to whether, in the opinion of each such individual, such condition or covenant has been complied with.
Section 103. Form of Documents Delivered to Trustee.
In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary
that all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one
document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such Persons as to other
matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.
Any certificate or opinion of an Officer (or any Person designated in writing by an Officer of the Company as authorized to execute and
deliver the Securities) may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel,
unless such Officer (or any such Person designated in writing by an Officer of the Company as authorized to execute and deliver the
Securities) knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the
matters upon which such Officer’s (or such Person’s) certificate or opinion is based are erroneous. Any such certificate or Opinion of Counsel
may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an Officer or Officers of the
Company (or any Person or Persons designated in writing by an Officer of the Company as authorized to execute and deliver the Securities)
stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Company, unless such counsel knows, or in the
exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.
Counsel delivering an Opinion of Counsel may also rely as to factual matters on certificates of governmental or other officials customary for
opinions of the type required.
Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions
or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument.
Section 104. Acts of Holders; Record Dates.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be
given, made or taken by Holders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such
Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become
effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such
instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the “Act” of the
Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be
sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and, subject to Section 601, conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the
manner provided in this Section 104.
