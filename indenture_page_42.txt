The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices or agencies where the Securities of one or more series
may be presented or surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such designations; provided, however, that
no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency in each Place of
Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or
rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or agency.
With respect to any Global Security, and except as otherwise may be specified for such Global Security as contemplated by
Section 301, the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee shall be the Place of Payment where such Global Security may be presented or
surrendered for payment or for registration of transfer or exchange, or where successor Securities may be delivered in exchange therefor; and
such Place of Payment with respect to a Global Security in New York, New York shall be at an office of the Trustee located at 101 Barclay
Street, Floor 4W, New York, New York 10286, Attention: Corporate Trust Administration; provided, however, that any such payment,
presentation, surrender or delivery effected pursuant to the Applicable Procedures of the Depositary for such Global Security shall be deemed
to have been effected at the Place of Payment for such Global Security in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.
Section 1003. Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust.
If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date
for the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any of the Securities of such series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the
Holders of such Securities a sum sufficient to pay the principal and premium, if any, and interest so becoming due until such sums shall be
paid to such Holders or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of Securities, it will, no later than 11:00 a.m. (New York
City time) on each due date for the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Securities of such series, deposit with a Paying Agent a
sum sufficient to pay such amount, such sum to be held in trust for the Holders of such Securities entitled to the same, and (unless such
Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.
The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an
instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section 1003, that such Paying Agent
shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee all money held by such Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on
the Securities and shall notify the Trustee in writing of any default by the Company in making any such payment.
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose,
pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such
sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and,
upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such
money.
Subject to any applicable abandoned property law, any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the
Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for
two years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if
then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general
creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money,
and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease.
