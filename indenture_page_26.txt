(by written notice to the Company and the Trustee) gives notice of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time
specified in clause (3) after receipt of such notice. Such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such
notice is a “Notice of Default.”
Section 502. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding (other than an Event of Default specified in
Section 501 (4) or (5) with respect to the Company) occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less
than 33% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series may declare the principal amount of all the Securities of
such series (or, if any Securities of that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities
as may be specified by the terms thereof), together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, to be due and payable immediately, by a
notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration, such principal amount (or specified
amount), together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified
in Section 501(4) or (5) with respect to the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs, the principal amount of all the Securities of
such series (or, in the case of any Security of such series which specifies an amount to be due and payable thereon upon acceleration of the
Maturity thereof, such amount as maybe specified by the terms thereof), together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, shall
automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or any Holder, become immediately due and payable.
Upon payment of such amount, all obligations of the Company in respect of the payment of principal and interest of the Securities of such
series shall terminate.
