(2) Securities for whose payment or redemption money in the necessary amount has been theretofore deposited with the Trustee or
any Paying Agent (other than the Company) in trust or set aside and segregated in trust by the Company (if the Company shall act
as its own Paying Agent) for the Holders of such Securities; provided that, if such Securities are to be redeemed, notice of such
redemption has been duly given pursuant to this Indenture or provision therefor satisfactory to the Trustee has been made;
(3) Securities as to which Defeasance has been effected pursuant to Section 1302;
(4) Securities which have been paid pursuant to Section 306 or in exchange for or in lieu of which other Securities have been
authenticated and delivered pursuant to this Indenture, other than any such Securities in respect of which there shall have been
presented to the Trustee proof satisfactory to it that such Securities are held by a bona fide purchaser in whose hands such
Securities are valid obligations of the Company; and
(5) Securities as to which any property deliverable upon conversion thereof has been delivered (or such delivery has been made
available), or as to which any other particular conditions have been satisfied, in each case as may be provided for such Securities
as contemplated in Section 301;
provided, however, that in determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of the Outstanding Securities have given, made
or taken any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action hereunder as of any date, (A) the principal
amount of an Original Issue Discount Security which shall be deemed to be Outstanding shall be the amount of the principal thereof which
would be due and payable as of such date upon acceleration of the Maturity thereof to such date pursuant to Section 502, (B) if, as of such
date, the principal amount payable at the Stated Maturity of a Security is not determinable, the principal amount of such Security which shall
be deemed to be Outstanding shall be the amount as specified or determined as contemplated by Section 301, (C) the principal amount of a
Security denominated in one or more foreign currencies, composite currencies or currency units which shall be deemed to be Outstanding
shall be the U.S. dollar equivalent, determined as of such date in the manner provided as contemplated by Section 301, of the principal
amount of such Security (or, in the case of a Security described in clause (A) or (B) above, of the amount determined as provided in such
clause), and (D) Securities owned by the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or any Affiliate of the Company or of such other
obligor shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding, except that, in determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying
upon any such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, only Securities which a Responsible Officer
of the Trustee knows to be so owned shall be so disregarded. Securities so owned which have been pledged in good faith may be regarded
as Outstanding if the pledgee establishes to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee’s right so to act with respect to such Securities and
that the pledgee is not the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities or any Affiliate of the Company or of such other obligor.
“Paying Agent” means any Person authorized by the Company to pay the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on any Securities on
behalf of the Company. The Company initially authorizes and appoints the Trustee as the Paying Agent for each series of the Securities.
“Person” means any individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, association, joint-stock company, trust,
unincorporated organization or government or any agency or political subdivision thereof or any other entity.
“Place of Payment” means, when used with respect to the Securities of any series, the place or places where the principal of and
premium, if any, and interest on the Securities of such series are payable as specified as contemplated by Section 301.
“Predecessor Security” means, with respect to any particular Security, every previous Security evidencing all or a portion of the same
debt as that evidenced by such particular Security; and, for the purposes of this definition, any Security authenticated and delivered under
Section 306 in exchange for or in lieu of a mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be deemed to evidence the same debt as the
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security.
