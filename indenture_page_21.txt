Section 305. Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office and in
any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the “Security Register”) in
which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and of transfers
of Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed “Security Registrar” for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities as
herein provided.
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of a series at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment for
such series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or
transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor and principal amount.
At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized
denominations and of like tenor and principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever
any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities
which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company,
evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of
transfer or exchange.
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee)
be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly
executed, by the Holder thereof or such Holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing.
No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange
of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, Section 906, Section 1107 or Section 1405 not involving any transfer.
If the Securities of any series (or of any series and specified tenor) are to be redeemed in part, the Company shall not be required (A) to
issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of such series (or of such series and specified tenor, as the case may be) during a
period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of any such Securities selected
for redemption under Section 1103 and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (B) to register the transfer of or
exchange any Security so selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
The provisions of clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) of this paragraph shall apply only to Global Securities:
(1) Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such
Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such
Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this Indenture.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, and subject to such applicable provisions, if any, as may be specified as
contemplated by Section 301, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer
of a Global Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global
Security or a nominee thereof unless (A) such Depositary has notified the Company that it is unwilling or unable or no longer
permitted under applicable law to continue as Depositary for such Global Security, (B) there shall have occurred and be continuing
an Event of Default with respect to such Global Security, (C) the Company so directs the Trustee by a Company Order or (D) there
shall exist such circumstances, if any, in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as have been specified for this purpose as
contemplated by Section 301.
