The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument or writing may be proved in any manner which the Trustee
reasonably deems sufficient. Where such execution is by a Person acting in a capacity other than such Person’s individual capacity, such
certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of such Person’s authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument
or writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.
The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register.
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future
Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu
thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation
of such action is made upon such Security.
The Company may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series
entitled to give, make or take any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided or permitted by
this Indenture to be given, made or taken by Holders of Securities of such series; provided that the Company may not set a record date for,
and the provisions of this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, the giving or making of any notice, declaration, request or direction
referred to in the next paragraph. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the relevant
series on such record date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to take the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders
after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by
Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be
construed to prevent the Company from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to
this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect),
and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of
Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this
paragraph, the Company, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable
Expiration Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Sections
105 and 106.
The Trustee may set any day as a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series
entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any Notice of Default, (ii) any declaration of acceleration referred to in Section 502, (iii) any request
to institute proceedings referred to in Section 507(2) or (iv) any direction referred to in Section 511, in each case with respect to Securities of
such series. If any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date,
and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders remain Holders
after such record date; provided that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by
Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be
construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to
this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect),
and nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of
Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this
paragraph, the Trustee, at the Company’s expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable
Expiration Date to be given to the Company in writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in
Sections 105 and 106.
With respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section 104, the party hereto which sets such record dates may designate any day
as the “Expiration Date” and from time to time may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day; provided that no such change shall
be effective unless notice of the proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other party hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of
the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated
with respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section 104, the party hereto which set such record date shall be deemed to have initially
designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration Date
as provided in this paragraph.
