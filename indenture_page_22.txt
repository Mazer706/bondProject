(3) Subject to clause (2) above, and subject to such applicable provisions, if any, as may be specified as contemplated by
Section 301, any exchange of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in
exchange for a Global Security or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security
shall direct.
(4) Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any
portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Section 305, Section 304, Section 306, Section 906, Section 1107 or Section 1405 or
otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security, unless such Security is registered in
the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof.
The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed
under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security (including any transfers between or
among Depositary participants or beneficial owners of interests in any Global Security) other than to require delivery of such certificates and
other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture,
and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.
Neither the Trustee nor any agent of the Trustee shall have any responsibility for any actions taken or not taken by the Depositary.
Section 306. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in
exchange therefor a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously
outstanding and shall cancel and dispose of such mutilated security in accordance with its customary procedures.
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (1) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any
Security and (2) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then,
in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall
execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series
and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its
discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section 306, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of
counsel to the Company and the fees and expenses of the Trustee and its counsel) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section 306 in lieu of any mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall
constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be
at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other
Securities of such series duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section 306 are exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
