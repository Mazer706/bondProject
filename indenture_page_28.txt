Section 504. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Securities), its property or its creditors, the
Trustee shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the
Trust Indenture Act in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be
authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any
custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to
the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it and any predecessor Trustee under Section 607.
No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any
Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to
authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding; provided, however, that the Trustee may, on behalf
of the Holders, vote for the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and be a member of a creditorsâ€™ or other similar committee.
Section 505. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities.
All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the
possession of any of the Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the
Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, any predecessor Trustee under Section 607, its agents
and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.
Section 506. Application of Money Collected.
Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article V shall be applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the
Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or premium, if any, or interest, upon presentation of the
Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:
FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 607;
SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of and premium, if any, and interest on the Securities
in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind (other
than contractual subordination agreements pursuant to the Indenture), according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for
principal and premium, if any, and interest, respectively; and
THIRD: To the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company.
Section 507. Limitation on Suits.
No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this
Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator or sequestrator (or similar official) or for any other remedy
hereunder, unless:
(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of

written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as Trustee hereunder;
