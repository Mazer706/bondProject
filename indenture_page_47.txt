Section 1302. Defeasance and Discharge.
Upon the Company’s exercise of its option, if any, to have this Section 1302 applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the
case may be, or if this Section 1302 shall otherwise apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, the Company
shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section 1302 on and after the
date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter called “Defeasance”). For this purpose, such Defeasance means that
the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Securities and to have satisfied all
its other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture insofar as such Securities are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the
Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated
or discharged hereunder: (1) the rights of Holders of such Securities to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 1304 and as
more fully set forth in such Section 1305, payments in respect of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on such Securities when
payments are due, (2) the Company’s obligations with respect to such Securities under Section 304, Section 305, Section 306, Section 1002
and Section 1003, (3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (4) this Article XIII. Subject to compliance
with this Article XIII, the Company may exercise its option, if any, to have this Section 1302 applied to the Securities of any series
notwithstanding the prior exercise of its option, if any, to have Section 1303 applied to such Securities.
Section 1303. Covenant Defeasance.
Upon the Company’s exercise of its option, if any, to have this Section 1303 applied to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the
case may be, or if this Section 1303 shall otherwise apply to any Securities or any series of Securities, as the case may be, (1) the Company
shall be released from its obligations under any covenants provided pursuant to Section 301(21), Section 901(1) or Section 901(8) for the
benefit of the Holders of such Securities and (2) the occurrence of any event specified in Section 501(3) and Section 501(6) shall be deemed
not to be or result in an Event of Default, in each case with respect to such Securities as provided in this Section 1303 on and after the date
the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter called “Covenant Defeasance”). For this purpose, such Covenant
Defeasance means that, with respect to such Securities, the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any
term, condition or limitation set forth in any such specified Section, whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein
to any such Section or by reason of any reference in any such Section to any other provision herein or in any other document, but the
remainder of this Indenture and such Securities shall be unaffected thereby.
Section 1304. Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.

funds in trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the
benefits of the Holders of such Securities, (A) money in an amount, or (B) U.S. Government Obligations which through the
scheduled payment of principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount, or
(C) a combination thereof, in each case sufficient, in the opinion of an independent public accountant or financial advisor
expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be applied by the
Trustee (or any such other qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge, the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on such
Securities on the respective Stated Maturities, in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and such Securities. As used herein,
“U.S. Government Obligation” means (x) any security which is (i) a direct obligation of the United States of America for the
payment of which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged or (ii) an obligation of a Person controlled or
supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United States of America the payment of which is unconditionally
guaranteed as a full faith and credit obligation by the United States of America, which, in either case (i) or (ii), is not callable or
redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) any depositary receipt issued by a bank (as defined in Section 3(a)(2) of the

such bank for the account of the holder of such depositary receipt, or with respect to any specific payment of principal of or interest
on any U.S. Government Obligation which is so specified and held; provided that (except as required by law) such custodian is not
