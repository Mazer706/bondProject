Section 609. Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.
There shall at all times be one (and only one) Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of each series, which may be Trustee
hereunder for Securities of one or more other series. Each Trustee shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act
as such, has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and has its Corporate Trust Office in the Borough of Manhattan, The City
of New York or any other major city in the United States that is acceptable to the Company. If any such Person publishes reports of condition
at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of its supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section 609
and to the extent permitted by the Trust Indenture Act, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined
capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent annual report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee with respect to the
Securities of any series shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 609, it shall resign immediately in the
manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article VI.
Section 610. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article VI shall become effective
until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611.
The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company.
If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days
after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee, at the expense of the Company, may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series, upon written notice delivered to the Trustee and to the Company. If the
instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the
giving of such notice of removal, the Trustee being removed, at the expense of the Company, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction
for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
If at any time:
(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 608 after written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a
bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months, or
(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by
any such Holder, or
(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its
property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the
purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,
then, in any such case, (A) the Company may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities or (B) subject to Section 513, Holders of 10%
in aggregate principal amount of Securities of any series who have been bona fide Holders of such Securities for at least six months may, on
behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to
all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.
If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause,
with respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the
Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one
or more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and
shall comply with the applicable requirements of Section 611. If a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be
appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the
Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in
accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and
to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any
series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 611,
Holders of 10% in aggregate principal amount of Securities of any series who have been bona fide Holders of Securities of such series for at
least six months may, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment
of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
